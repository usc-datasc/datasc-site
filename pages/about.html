    <em><h3>Our Mission: To foster an environment in which individuals across subjects and experience levels are able to learn Data Science and collaboratively engage in exploring cross-disciplinary topics thorugh its practical applications.</h3></em>
    <h3>Compete</h3>
    <p>If you're feeling confident in your abilities then <strong>competitions</strong> and <strong>projects</strong> are avenues in which you can try your hand at applying your knowledge!</p>
    <p>Members can form teams to pursue projects in fields and subjects of interest and/or take part in competitions such as those on Kaggle.com -- there are no hard and fast restrictions and <strong>members have the freedom to decide on what and how things can be approached!</strong></p>
    <h3>Events and Workshops</h3>
    <p>We aim to host <strong>speaker sessions</strong> and <strong>panel events</strong> with industry leaders like NVIDIA, Microsoft, Google, and Meta; and will provide <strong>career support</strong> through things such as interview workshops, headshot taking, and networking formation and support.</p>
    <h3>Socials</h3>
    <p>Despite CS and Math major stereotypes, we will host <strong>actually fun social events</strong> on a regular but not-overly-frequent basis</p>
